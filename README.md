This is a react native app that lets users search for recipes from all around the world. This app has three different screens:
-Home Screen
-Recipe Detail Screen
-Favorite Screen

I implemented a three components that let the user:
-Search for recipes in real time using state hooks and filtering methods
-Tap on an icon to add/remove a recipe from their favorite list using State Hooks 
-Navigate seamlessly between screens using Flatlist navigation
